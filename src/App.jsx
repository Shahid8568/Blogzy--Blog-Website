        desc: "Football, also known as soccer in some countries, is a beloved sport around the world. However, in recent years, there has been a growing concern that money is having a negative impact on the sport. Here are just a few examples of how money is ruining football:Widening the gap between wealthy and less wealthy teams: The influx of money into football, particularly from wealthy owners and sponsors, has led to a widening gap between the top teams and the rest.This has resulted in a less competitive league and a lack of parity among teams.Changing the way the game is played: In an effort to win at all costs, some teams and coaches have begun to prioritize winning over the style of play.This has led to a decline in the quality of play and a decrease in the number of goals scored, which can make the game less exciting for fans.Prices for tickets and merchandise are increasing: The increase of money in the game causes the prices of tickets and merchandise to rise, making it harder for fans to afford to attend matches or buy gear.Disregard for tradition and fans: With an increased focus on profits, many clubs have started to place less importance on the traditions and history of the team, as well as the fans' experience. This has led to an erosion of the special bond between clubs and their supporters.Financial Fair Play regulations are not enforced: Financial Fair Play regulations were introduced to prevent clubs from overspending, however it has not been enforced properly.As a result, clubs with wealthy owners can continue to outspend their competitors, leading to an unfair advantage.Corrupted game: Some clubs, agents and players are corrupted by money and influence, leading to match- fixing, illegal betting, and other forms of corruption that undermines the integrity of the game.It's important to remember that money has also brought some benefits to the game, such as increased exposure and investment in infrastructure. However, the negative impacts are undeniable. To preserve the true spirit of the game and protect it from the negative effects of money, it is important that football governing bodies, clubs, and fans work together to find a balance and return the focus back to the sport and its supporters.In conclusion, while money has brought some benefits to the game, it has also had a significant negative impact on football, causing a widening gap between wealthy and less wealthy teams, changing the way the game is played, increasing prices for tickets and merchandise, disregarding tradition and fans, and risking the integrity of the game.It's important that action is taken to address these issues and balance the role of money in football.",

        title: "What ChaGPt is and How it Works?",
        desc: "As the hype is going around the AI-based tool ChatGPT, people are curious to know what this tool is, and what it is capable of. How does it work, are there any limitations of ChatGPT? Do we need such tools? Let's find out the answers.The human mind is creative and innovative and it has no limitations, they always work on inventing something innovative and extraordinary like Artificial intelligence. AI is one of the creations which imitates human intellect that has been incorporated into machines, especially computer systems. Some examples of AI applications are expert systems, natural language processing, speech recognition, and machine vision. Chat GPT is also an AI-based program that is used for producing dialogues and it is highly popular among users. The chatbot has a language-based model that is used for interactive communication with humans. It's a virtual chatbot largely designed for specific services, if you are interested to know what ChatGPT is and how it works? this article is useful for you, keep reading.What is ChatGPT?ChatGPT is an AI chatbot auto-generative system created by OpenAI for online users. It is a language model rather than a chatbot, it is often used in Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications. It gathers data from various sources like websites, textbooks, and various articles, which it uses to perfect its language for answering human conversation. It created quite a buzz especially among the artificial intelligence (AI) communities because this tool is trained and can answer any topic under the sun; Since it is a conversational tool, experts in the AI community call this momentous, emphasising how powerful ChatGPT is. OpenAI is a company that focuses on responsibly developing artificial intelligence technology. OpenAI was founded in 2015 by entrepreneurs and researchers, including Elon Musk, Sam Altman, and Greg Brockman. ChatGPT was launched on November 30, 2022, as a prototype and rapidly gained attention for its thorough replies and coherent answers across several domains of knowledge. Hope it answers what chatGPt is and how  it works?Beginning of ChatGPT.ChatGPT tracks a generation of language models that were released by OpenAI in 2018. It is a neural network. The training process and the technology are collectively known as Reinforcement Learning. A neural network can be conceptualised as a huge network of computers that can fine-tune its output of words based on the feedback provided to it throughout stages of training. Large text corpora are frequently used as input data. These technologies are all a part of the rapidly advancing field of artificial intelligence, commonly known as machine learning. ChatGPT is the successor to GPT3.5; it was released in early 2022. Each model is more progressive than its prototype. For example, GPT-3 had 175 billion parameters. These huge language models searched almost all information available on the web and many other transcript documents, which makes them extremely conversant. Because the neural network behind ChatGPT has also been trained on conversational transcripts with human feedback, it has been fine-tuned to generate conversational responses as opposed to essay-type text. Other language models are also well-liked in the AI community, such as Google's BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers). However, for conversational purposes, ChatGPT appears to be the most effective.Attributes of ChatGPT.The important feature of Chat GPT is generating responses like humans. It is much more than a chatbot. If you ask it to write a program or even a simple software application, it will respond with process and coding for the program and software application. Hence, it is appropriate for chatbots, AI system conversations, and computer-generated assistants. It gives a natural answer to questions during communication and also generates stories and poems. It is capable of the following:Write a code,Write an articles,Translate,Debugging,Write a story/poem.Chat GPT-3 can understand the context of a conversation and create suitable responses. It is because of the use of self-attention mechanisms, which permits the network to weigh the position of different words and phrases in the input text based on their significance to the task at hand.The capability of Chat GPT-3 to produce text that is consistent and cohesive, even with a limited amount of input, is another important characteristic. It is because of Modifiers, which can represent long-range dependencies in the input text and produce coherent word sequences.The Responsive AI|| The accuracy of any language model or ChatGPT can be calculated through standard methods. One such method is the “Recall-Oriented substitute for Gisting assessment” or the ROUGE metric, which evaluates ChatGPT's content output against a reference planned content and calculates the success percentage of overlap. The BLEU metre (Bilingual Evaluation UnderStudy) is another metric used to analyse control in interpreted material with a typical translation for language models like GPT that are also used in translation.In addition, the human type of response-generating ability and the conversational nature of the tool is very appealing. ChatGPT has the potential to become a powerful chatbot to educate on various topics provided the right instructions are given to the tool. It can simply explain anything from philosophy to narrating stories for fun and cooking recipes, including suggestions on new recipes. ChatGPT is the most powerful NLP tool for conversational purposes as of now. However, it wouldn't be true for specialised contexts. For instance, if doctors need an automatic conversational assistant for medical queries, the neural networks behind ChatGPT need to be trained on a specific subject. Considering that ChatGPT is trained in writing programs, there is a possibility to make it knowledgeable for any specific topic.|| Opportunities in AI Segment|Apart from knowing what ChatGPT is and how it works? We should also learn about artificial intelligence and its opportunities. Artificial Intelligence or AI career opportunities have been rising due to huge demand in industries.

        title: "Virat Kholi: Journey Between 70's to 71's Century",
        desc: "Virat Kohli, the Indian cricket team's former captain, has taken the cricket world by storm since his international debut in August 2008. In a short span of time, Kohli has established himself as one of the greatest batsmen of all time and has already amassed an impressive list of records and achievements.Kohli's rise to the top of the cricketing world was not an overnight success story. It was built on years of hard work, determination, and an unrelenting pursuit of excellence. Kohli's aggressive batting style and relentless work ethic have earned him widespread acclaim, and his popularity has only continued to grow with each passing year.In One Day Internationals (ODIs), Kohli has amassed 43 centuries, which is the most by any Indian player and the fifth-most by any player in the world. He has also scored 27 Test centuries, making him one of the few batsmen in the world to have more than 25 centuries in both formats of the game.Kohli's ability to score runs consistently and in high-pressure situations sets him apart from other batsmen. He has a remarkable average of 59.33 in ODIs and 53.25 in Test cricket, which is a testament to his longevity and ability to perform under pressure.Kohli's hunger for success and his never-say-die attitude has earned him the nickname “Run Machine.” He is a true leader on and off the field, inspiring his teammates with his determination and fierce competitiveness. His exceptional work ethic and passion for the game have made him a role model for young cricketers worldwide.It's important to remember that all athletes, regardless of their skill and success, go through ups and downs in their careers. No one is immune to poor form or struggles, and it's not uncommon for even the greatest players to go through rough patches.In Kohli's case, it's important to note that he is only human and has faced many challenges, both on and off the field. It's not fair to single him out and criticize him, especially when there are so many other factors at play, such as the impact of COVID-19 on the cricketing calendar and the pressure of performing in high-stakes tournaments like the IPL.It's also important to remember that the criticism he has faced is not representative of the larger cricketing community. Many fans, players, and analysts continue to admire and respect Kohli for his talent and contributions to the sport.As for the criticism towards Kohli's wife and daughter, it is unacceptable and should not be tolerated. Personal lives and family should be off-limits and not used to criticize an athlete's performance.But the special thing about time is that it changes.In an Asia Cup 2022 Super Four encounter against Afghanistan in Dubai, Virat Kohli scored his first T20I century for India, breaking a 1019-day wait for his 71st international century. Throughout his innings, Kohli broke a lot of records. In place of Rohit Sharma, the Indian captain, Kohli started the innings. Ibrahim Zadran of Afghanistan dropped Kohli while he was on 28. With 276 runs in five innings, he has now scored the most runs in this Asia Cup. Prior to the competition, Kohli has played in just four T20Is this year, totaling 81 runs in just four innings. The 33-year-old had earlier achieved an international century on November 23, 2019, in Kolkata, during a pink-ball Test match against Bangladesh.",

            title: "Challenges to Christian Apologetic Witness in a Globalizing World",
                desc: "For Christians in many parts of the world, such as South Asia, the Middle East, and Africa, religious pluralism has always been a fact of life. Yet, Christians in Europe and North America lived for many centuries in relatively homogenous Christian societies. With the rise of modernity, the main challenges to their faith did not come from other religions, but from Enlightenment rationalism, secularism, and later from postmodern relativism. Western Christian apologetics has therefore been ill-equipped to deal with the apologetic challenges presented by other religions and by radically different cultural outlooks on life.Because of the global dominance of Western theology, this limitation has influenced Christian apologetics more widely. This is one of the reasons that apologetics is often experienced as irrelevant, because it is too Western and intellectualist. Local intellectual challenges were often addressed without reference to apologetics. John Mbiti and other representatives of the first generation of modern African theologians, for example, gave significant attention to the question of whether the God of the Bible was already known in Sub-Saharan Africa before the missionaries arrived (Concepts of God in Africa). This was in fact an apologetic question, because one of the greatest challenges to Christianity in Africa was precisely that Christianity was the White man's religion and therefore not for Africans (Jesse N. K. Mugambi, Critiques of Christianity in African Literature). Mbiti was addressing this challenge by showing that this God was already in Africa before the missionaries came, but did so under what we would call “African contextual theology” rather than apologetics.Religious pluralism presents one of the main apologetic challenges in today's world. This is now also true for the Western world which through the media and international migration is confronted with the depth, existential relevance, and vitality of other religious traditions at a time when the Christian faith is waning and often suspect. At one level, the experience of religious pluralism in general can easily undermine the credibility of any particular religion. At another level, each religious tradition presents its own particular apologetic challenges for Christian witness. The more general challenge of religious pluralism will also present itself differently depending on which cultural and religious traditions shape the cultural environment. In a secular environment, it may lead to the idea that all religions are mere human constructs. In a Hindu context, it may lead to a belief that there exists an unknown divine mystery beyond every particular religion and that each one should simply adhere to the tradition in which they are born. Religious pluralism is closely related to cultural pluralism, because religious outlooks deeply shape cultures. They are not the same, however, for particular religious traditions can be expressed in different cultural forms. Southeast Asian Islam looks different from the Islam of the Arabic heartlands. In a different manner, the Christian faith can also be embodied or incarnated in many cultural forms. Just as religious pluralism has led to religious relativism (the idea that no one can make a universal religious claim), cultural pluralism has led to cultural relativism (the idea that what we believe to be true is determined by our cultural location).Taken from Humble Confidence by Benno van den Toren and Kang-San Tan.

            title: "Dubai: The Most Innovative Place To Visit",
                desc: "UAE is perhaps one of the rare places with innovative places to visit for its visitors. Besides known for having worlds' largest mall, The Dubai Mall, UAE government is always striving to develop innovative projects to remain a spectacular host as the worlds' most preferred destination.Why Dubai?Dubai, one of the seven states of the Emirates (United Arab Emirates) has a life full of entertainment and surprises. Be it day or night, life is active all the time. Dubai does not only host multicultural diverse population groups, but it displays the style, food, and culture of different ethnicities. Although it is assumed by many that a visit to Dubai is often expensive, this might not be fully true, but the grants spent is worth the experience one might have there. So what can one expect to see there?Innovative slit in the Sea:Palm Jumeirah, the man-crafted 'archipelago' (group of islands) is the outcome of five years of efforts. The Island was carved by pouring mud tearing apart the sea. It comprises hotels and resorts, restaurants, villas and hotel residences. The view is spectacular from top symbolizing the palm tree. This creative output leaves the audiences wondering about the extent to which innovations are innovative.Innovative Transformation through Frame:The Dubai Frame, a lens that exemplifies the transformation Dubai went through from sand dungeon fishing market to the host of most innovative projects in the world. The Dubai Frame, as referred to the 'largest frame on earth'. The materials used in constructing this frame included glass, steel, aluminium and concrete. What is even more surprising is its inception and positioning in such a way that it allows its spectators to view the older and Modern Dubai simultaneously on viewing each side of the frame. A walk through the frame is an untold experience in itself. Reading a description of hearing stories of it can never match up the experience of the walkers walking through the transparent and strong glass floors.Gardens are no exception - Miraculously Redefined:-Skyscrapers, Sea, Island and glass frames, is that all? Botanical Gardens are no exception for Dubai's' way of thinking. The Dubai Miracle Garden, launched on Valentines' Day in 2013, marks the worlds' largest natural flower garden. A walk through the garden can enable viewers to see as many as 50 million varieties of flowers and around 250 million species of plants. To many tourists' astonishment, the experience in this garden has been to the extent that no other garden could even match up to. To kid's entertainment, they can never get bored or tired while exploring this garden. Thanks to Walt Disney's interest that trees, shrubs, and twigs are trimmed to represent Disney characters like Mickey, Minnie, Pluto, Donald and many more.The efforts of the UAE government to introduce a new invention each year will continue to evolve. For tourists willing to take a one time unmatched experience and to assure that innovations are never-ending, Dubai is certainly a place to visit.",

            title: "Digital Solutions To Help Tackle Homelessness",
                desc: "Homelessness is sadly an ongoing challenge for people all over the world, and it affects those from many different cultures and social backgrounds. Fortunately, there are organizations that help them break the cycle of homelessness, find permanent housing, and rebuild their lives. One of these organizations is Teen Challenge, whose Wrocław branch sought support in creating a new website. Their goal was to explain the organization's work and target different audiences to boost donations and other forms of support. Teen Challenge reached out to Tech To The Rescue and was matched with Digital New Agency (DNA), who got to work on coming up with a solution. We spoke to Radosław Lont, Head of Agile (DNA) and Bolek Rosinski, Product Designer at DNA, to find out more about the project and partnership.Welcome. Could you introduce DNA and tell us a little bit about what you do?Radosław: Digital New Agency (DNA) is a tech partner supporting other companies in solving a range of technological challenges. We enter into long-term partnerships with clients, but recently we've also started supporting NGOs, which we'll talk more about today.Could you tell us how you first came across Tech To The Rescue?Radosław: Yes. We started looking for CSR projects we could take part in during the second half of 2020. We felt that our company had grown to the point where we had the resources and capacity to take on such a project. Tech To The Rescue had done some great advertising during that time, and I found them very quickly online. The great thing about Tech To The Rescue is that you match projects based on companies' capabilities and availability. That way we can save the time we would need to put into searching a project on our own.What was your motivation for getting involved in pro-bono projects?Radosław: We've always been very purpose-driven and we're passionate about providing solutions to complex problems. If our product ends up making someone's life better, it gives us extra motivation to work. We offer each employee four hours a week (so-called 'Slack time') to spend on things that matter to them. It can be used on education, pro bono projects, wellbeing or anything else. Of course, when individuals or teams are not engaged in any product for a while, they can dedicate even more time for pro bono activities.Great. Could you tell us about the project you worked on for Teen Challenge Wroclaw?Radosław: Yes, certainly. At the beginning I would like to explain the nature of Teen Challenge's work. It's an organization that helps young people find a way out of homelessness. They wanted to create a new, engaging website, which would not only explain their mission, but also encourage support and donations. This is where we came in. We were tasked with creating both the desktop and mobile versions of the website.And how did the process begin?Bolek: We used the UX process that we use when working on these types of projects for clients. It begins with the discovery phase, in which we identify the needs of the organization. We also take a deep dive into the target audience - including their challenges and pain points. Then we define our hypotheses, based on which we ideate and later create the first prototype of the product. The idea was to create a feedback loop on our designs and iterate until we came up with the best possible solution.The initial research was conducted within a week, and it included several surveys of different potential target audience groups. We wanted to find out what would motivate potential website users to support a given organization. Here, Tech To The Rescue's support was very valuable in helping us connect with the right people. Thanks to the results of this research, we were able to verify our hypotheses, create a site map and a low fidelity mockup.Great. And could you tell us a bit more about what happened when you designed the pages?Bolek: Yes, definitely. In the phase of creating the low-fidelity wireframes, we were able to map out the different building blocks that would form the in-page taxonomy of each page. In this phase, we also considered the messaging and user journeys of each target audience because there were several: businesses, individuals, media and churches. In each case, there were different ways they could support Teen Challenge.Were there any challenges that you faced along the way?Bolek: One of the biggest challenges was establishing an effective hierarchy of information. Teen Challenge had a lot to say and they wanted to put a lot of information on the homepage. We were able to help them focus on their messaging so that the homepage didn't get too cluttered. The organization has its roots in the Catholic Church, and initially a lot of their messaging was centered around this, while the target audience had evolved. So it was a matter of deciding how to reframe the narrative without offending anyone.Did you have any 'aha'moments during the project?Radosław: For me it was about the fact that it was just as important to show the people supported by the project — i.e. the homeless young people, as it was to show those who were helping them. It's crucial to create a sense of credibility to an organization like Teen Challenge, which has been doing important work for years. But the end users of the website, who may not yet be aware of their work, need to develop trust in them. And that's why it's so important to use images on the website to show who they are and what they do, and to describe their mission effectively.What are your future plans when it comes to further NGO support?Radosław: We currently have two projects on the go. Since we're doing them in the before-mentioned 'Slack time,'each project is progressing at its own pace — one a little faster than the other. The great thing about these projects, particularly when organized by Tech To The Rescue, is that they need very little formalities or paperwork. This means you can get started quickly and add value immediately.Is there anything else that you have learned from the process which you thought was worth sharing?Radosław: I thought it's worth adding that of course every NGO is different — they vary in size and scope of work. Some have permanent employees on the ground, others are volunteer-driven. Many have never worked with an IT consulting company before, and need to be taught how the process works from start to finish. So you need to approach the collaboration with a very open mind and know that you might need to adjust the way you're used to working. That goes for both sides. It's important to find a common language, review things along the way and make sure that everyone is in agreement, and also to set some clear expectations from the start. Here's where Tech To The Rescue plays a big part, sending out surveys to each NGO before they start working with their tech partner. That's a real game-changer when it comes to matching NGOs with tech providers.Thank you Radosław and Bolek, and we wish you all the best of luck in your future endeavors!",
